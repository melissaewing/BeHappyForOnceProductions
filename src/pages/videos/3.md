Astrological Disturbance is Episode 2 of the hit show Band Nightmares. Celebrity pop icon Gene Baker works tirelessly to help #MILLENNIALS in #BROOKLYN fix their sound so that they may enter the music business confidently and with guaranteed success. After discovering Hope Diamond at an open mic, he decides that in order to reach success she must learn that there is no astrological basis in the music business.
